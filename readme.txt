ARKCommerce is a payment gateway that provides ARK crypto currency payment services for WooCommerce stores

== Description ==

ARKCommerce is a payment gateway that provides [ARK](https://www.ark.io) crypto currency payment services for WooCommerce store operators on WordPress platform by utilising the ARK blockchain. Fully based on open source code and architecture, ARKCommerce aims to provide the necessary e-commerce infrastructure with the goal of wider market acceptance for ARK by both customers and merchants. Online merchants struggle with risk-free and timely digital product delivery via established fiat currency payment intermediaries. This makes for a particularly suitable use case for crypto currency payments that happen in a trustless, straightforward, and automated fashion.

ARKCommerce leverages the versatility of ARK blockchain that features a special field called SmartBridge which enables user input as part of the transaction, whereas 8 second block times facilitate prompt transaction confirmations. All orders placed through ARKCommerce are placed on-hold until repetitive ARK blockchain queries reveal a transaction for an appropriate amount of ARK and with a correct order reference making a deposit into the monitored ARK wallet address belonging to the store, all without requiring or storing wallet passphrases.

== Features ==

* Supports pricing in both fiat currency conversion and natively in ARK
* Automatic exchange rate synchronisation for supported currencies (Coinmarketcap.com API)
* Market/above-market/fixed store exchange rate selection
* Dual price display, supports all WooCommerce Product types and price formats
* Fully automatic order processing, metadata recording and transaction discovery via ARK/DARK Node API
* Order timeout limit support for risk management
* Theme-agnostic integration into WooCommerce and WordPress
* Detailed ARKCommerce event administrator/store manager email notifications available
* Customer-facing FAQ and Currency Converter widgets
* Administrator dashboard widgets, WooCommerce Order meta box, ARKCommerce Navigator and ARKCommerce Information pages
* Fully internationalisation-ready

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/arkcommerce` folder, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins section.
1. Create an ARK Wallet Address for the store by using the [Desktop](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop/releases) or [Online](https://arkecosystem.github.io/ark-lite-wallet/app/) or [Mobile](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-mobile) clients.
